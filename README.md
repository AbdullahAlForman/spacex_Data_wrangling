## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to clean and preprocess SpaceX launch data to make it suitable for further analysis and visualization. This involves handling missing values, converting data types, extracting relevant information, and creating new features to gain insights into SpaceX's launch activities.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about SpaceX launches, including launch dates, rocket types, launch sites, payload information, and more. The dataset is loaded and processed within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
SpaceX-Data-Wrangling/
├── spacex-Data-wrangling-v2.ipynb
├── README.md
└── data/
    └── spacex_launch_data.csv
```

- `spacex-Data-wrangling-v2.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data wrangling steps and analysis.
- `README.md`: This README file.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset file.

## Data Wrangling Steps

The Jupyter Notebook includes the following data wrangling steps:

1. **Loading the Dataset**: Importing the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and correcting data types.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and extracting relevant information.
4. **Data Visualization**: Plotting data to gain insights into SpaceX launches.

## Results

The data wrangling process results in a clean and well-structured dataset that can be used for further analysis. Key insights and visualizations are presented in the Jupyter Notebook, highlighting important aspects of SpaceX's launch activities.
